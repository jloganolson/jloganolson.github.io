## tl;dr 
* Trained a simple 'hello world' policy with Isaac and Mujoco that trains the robot to lift its left arm
* Many headaches around USD<>MJCF<>URDF so no deployment to hardware but cautiously optimistic we do it this week
* Created a new MJCF that reflects both the Mujoco menagerie's format and the latest Unitree G1 URDF and the PD values of the sdk2 repo
* Setup a new work computer (4090 is a huge improvement)
* The booties work!

## Learnings
* Grokked PD control (I think?) thanks to Gemini Canvas, where we vibecoded this [interactive toy demonstrating springs and damping](tab:https://g.co/gemini/share/0393ddbc4d21)

* The rest of the learnings for this are either lizard brain familiarity with the weird pointy bits of MJCF and USD or very specific things that I should probably write down for future me (e.g. cyclonedds works with python 3.10 but not 3.11)
* It feels good to train models again (it's been awhile!)

## Potential next steps
* Deploy the Mujoco policy
* If that works, deploy a balancing policy (or even... walking!)
* I might come back to Isaac but USDs, man... idk.

## tl;dr 
I trained and deployed my own balance policy!
![output](/assets/img/week-4/mujoco-balance.gif)

I [dumped it on github](tab:https://github.com/jloganolson/g1_basic_balance) in case other folks find it useful.

It's quite jank and brittle, per it just falling over with a light push - but hey it's a start!

## Learnings
* How to train and deploy a policy that uses the G1 IMU (it's on the pelvis, btw)
* Mujoco Playground is designed to be a showcase/demo repo, not as a foundation for actual work/research  

## Potential next steps
* Try out [LocoMuJoCo](tab:https://github.com/robfiras/loco-mujoco)
* Teleoperation with the Quest?
* Build the simplest real2sim2real project I could imagine (I just think the community could use that and now I might have the background/skills to do something about it... stay tuned!)
